        <li>Ollie</li>
        <li>Mona</li>
      </ol>

      <article>
        We currently have two bears at our zoo. Ollie is our male grizzly and
        Mona is our female. Ollie tends to sleep all day and likes to do so in
        odd places, so don't worry if you find him sleeping in strange areas.
        Mona is relatively active but sometimes likes to dig pits and watch the
        fish pond silently. She does not like it when Ollie sleeps next to her
        when this happens. Provide each with a variety of fruits, vegetables,
        meat, nuts and seeds, and insects and honey. New enrichment items will
        be provided every other day.

      <article>
        Our giraffes Frankie and Coconut are best friends! They tend to always
        stay together, even when eating or sleeping. Frankie likes to bow to
        Coconut. Both firaffes are fed a diet of fresh leaves, vegetables, and
        specially formulated giraffe pellets to ensure they have all the
        nutrients they need. They prefer snacks stuffed inside their hanging
        enrichment feeder toys. Coconut enjoys fresh coconut pieces while
        Frankie enjoys apples.

      <article>
        We currently home two lions: Karl, who is a male, and Mella who is a
        female. Exciting news! Mella is currently pregnant and due soon! Beware:
        Karl is incredibly playful but does not know his strength. Mella is more
        mellow and prefers to rest in shaded areas. Both lions are provided with
        a balanced diet of fresh meat and supplements. Mella should be monitored
        daily as she nears her due date.

      <article>
        We have three sibling monkeys: Cookie, Earl, and Banana Pudding. They
        are Lion-tailed macaques and are incredibly social. They love coming up
        to observe the visitors. They are not picky with their food and thus we
        provide them with a wide variety of fruits, flowers, leaves, insects,
        and fish. Beware: they have learned to team up to steal more snacks from
        the snack bucket.

      <article>
        We currently are home to three american alligators: Aspen, Mika, and
        Wren. Wren is our only albino of the zoo. He requires weekly brushing to
        remove the algae from his scutes and enjoys it very much! Aspen and Mika
        like to hang out at the docks together while Wren prefers to float
        around in the pool right under the waterfall. It is best to feed each
        individually as they all like to fight for food.
